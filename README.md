### Project Description
StickCycle is an utterly unnecessary 2D animation where a red-nosed stickman tries to balance his imaginary problems with an invisible bike. Poke his nose — he loses health. Chuck a rock — he loses money. Do nothing? He gets bored enough to exercise out of existential dread.

But wait! When boredom peaks (at a totally arbitrary 30%), Stickman spontaneously starts cycling on nothing. This somehow heals him. And makes him richer. Science? Logic? Who needs it?



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Bored stickmen with red noses are silently suffering.
They're poked. They're poor. They're standing on platforms doing absolutely nothing
They don’t even have a gym membership.
This must be stopped. Or started. We don’t know anymore.
